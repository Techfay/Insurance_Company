## AWS Services Used

| AWS Service                    | Purpose                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Elastic Beanstalk**          | Deploys and manages the Python app with auto-scaling and load balancing  |
| **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**    | Stores structured relational data such as user information, policies, and claims |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**            | Stores fast-access, non-relational data like customer-policy mappings and claim metadata |
| **Amazon S3**                  | Stores uploaded claim documents and auto-generated policy PDFs           |
| **Amazon SNS**                 | Sends real-time claim notifications (email/SMS)                          |
| **AWS Lambda**                 | Generates PDF documents after policy purchase                            |
| **Amazon CloudWatch**          | Monitors application logs, metrics, and alerts                           |
| **IAM Roles**                  | Manages secure, role-based access to AWS services                        |

---------------

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Framework**: Django
- **Database**: SQLite (Development)
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL), DynamoDB
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (S3, SNS, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudWatch, IAM)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for performance and health monitoring

----------------

## How It Works - Workflow

1. **Customer submits claim** â†’ Claim data is stored in **DynamoDB**
2. **Claim documents uploaded** â†’ Stored in **Amazon S3**
3. **SNS publishes notification** â†’ User and admin receive updates
4. **PDF policy generated** â†’ Stored in **S3** via **Lambda**
5. **All logs and activities tracked** â†’ Monitored via **CloudWatch**

----------------

## Deployment

This app is hosted on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, allowing easy scaling and management of the application without needing to handle infrastructure directly.

------------------

## Security & Best Practices

- **AWS IAM roles** for managing secure access to services
- **Environment variables** are used for storing sensitive keys, ensuring no credentials are hard-coded
- **S3 Bucket policies** to enforce encryption and access restrictions
- **IAM role-based access control** for managing which services and users have access to what.

-----------------

## Learnings & Outcomes

- Successfully integrated multiple **AWS services** into a cloud-native Django app.
- Gained hands-on experience with **Elastic Beanstalk** for deployment, scaling, and monitoring.
- Integrated **SNS** for real-time notifications and **CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring.
- Learned how to implement **AWS Lambda** for serverless operations (PDF generation).
- Designed a solution with both **RDS (structured)** and **DynamoDB (NoSQL)** for optimal data handling.
